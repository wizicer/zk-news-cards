ðŸ“„ One-Step Schnorr Threshold Identification
- https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/722
- Foteinos Mergoupis-Anagnou proposed OSST in the paper, a Schnorr-based threshold zk-identification protocol, which is non-interactive and does not depend on public shares, supporting cheap adoption in untrusted and dynamic environments.
- Notes:
  - Threshold zk identification protocol allows `t` members to jointly prove they know a secret
  - This protocol avoids the registration and authentication of each member's public key, making it suitable for dynamic or untrusted environments
  - The actual proof content, for example, can be _'we are proving we know the private key x'_
  - Applications include anonymous group authentication, decentralized identity systems, on-chain multi-signature control, IoT collaboration, cross-organization verification, etc.
  - OSST protocol is non-interactive and does not depend on public shares, supporting asynchronous communication and dynamic member joining
