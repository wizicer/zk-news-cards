- Nair et al. proposed a Jolt zkVM implementation in the paper, which reduces memory usage and has lower runtime overhead compared to existing recursive techniques.

ðŸ“„ Need for zkSpeed: Accelerating HyperPlonk for Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/620
- Daftardar et al. proposed zkSpeed in the paper, a hardware accelerator for HyperPlonk that supports one-time universal setup and small proof sizes, achieving a geometric mean acceleration ratio of 801.
