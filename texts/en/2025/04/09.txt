ðŸ“„ ColliderVM: Stateful Computation on Bitcoin
- https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/591
- Kolobov et al. proposed ColliderVM in the paper, a new method for executing stateful computations on Bitcoin, replacing traditional signature storage components with hash collision commitments, significantly reducing the length of STARK proof verification scripts.

ðŸ“„ zkPyTorch: A Hierarchical Optimized Compiler for Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning
- https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/535
- Xie et al. proposed zkPyTorch in the paper, a compiler that seamlessly integrates ML frameworks like PyTorch with ZKP engines like Expander, simplifying ZKML development. It automates ML operations to optimize ZKP circuits through three key components.
