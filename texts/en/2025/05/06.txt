📝 Audit of the Rust p256 Crate
- https://reports.zksecurity.xyz/reports/near-p256/
- @zksecurityXYZ conducted a security assessment of the Rust p256 crate, finding no major issues, with the codebase being well-tested and architecturally sound. The assessment covered elliptic curve operations, ECDSA signature verification, and field arithmetic. This audit report can serve as a learning reference for p256 curves.
- Notes:
  - P-256 optimization: Utilize the a=-3 property to accelerate calculations
  - ECDSA security: Must use a deterministic nonce (RFC6979)
  - Performance key: Precomputing 16 points improves signature speed
  - Important vulnerability: Random number generation may produce invalid values
  - Optimization tip: Removing redundant operations can speed up by 16%
