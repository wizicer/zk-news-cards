📄 Valida ISA Spec, version 1.0: A zk-Optimized Instruction Set Architecture
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08114
- Thomas等人在论文中讲解了Valida指令集架构，专为zkVM实现设计，旨在优化快速高效的执行证明。
- Notes:
  - Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) optimized for zkVMs to enhance ZK proof efficiency
  - No general-purpose registers; directly accesses RAM via stack offsets to reduce instruction count
  - Modular design; base version consists of specified chipset components
  - Harvard architecture, 32-bit little-endian, with only FP and PC as special-purpose registers
  - Interacts externally via read-only input and write-only output tapes, ideal for blockchain verifiable computation
  - Compared to RISC-V, significantly reduces SNARK proving overhead and improves performance
