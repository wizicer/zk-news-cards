ðŸ“„ Lattice-based signature aggregation
- https://ethresear.ch/t/lattice-based-signature-aggregation/22282
- David Nevado et al. explore lattice-based signature aggregation techniques in the paper , proposing a method to replace BLS signatures in the post-quantum era, with a focus on the efficient aggregation and verification performance of Falcon signatures.
- Notes:
  - BLS signatures are insecure in the quantum computing era, requiring post-quantum alternatives.
  - LaBRADOR is a lattice-based scheme that can aggregate Falcon signatures (quantum-resistant).
  - 10k signature aggregation results: 74KB proof, 5.95 seconds generation, 2.65 seconds verification.
  - Verification bottleneck: 90% time spent on serial step simple_reduce.
  - Compared to hash-based schemes (e.g., STARKs): verification is fast (106ms) but proofs are large (1.7MB).
  - Advantages of LaBRADOR: small proof size; disadvantages: slower verification than hash schemes.
  - Future directions: optimize parallel verification or combine with delegated proof techniques.
