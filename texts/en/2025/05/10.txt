ðŸ“„ HydraProofs: Optimally Computing All Proofs in a Vector Commitment
- https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/813
- Pappas et al. proposed HydraProofs in their paper, the first vector commitment scheme that can generate all opening proofs for a vector of size N in O(N) time, and is directly compatible with zkSNARKs families, significantly improving prover time.
- Notes:
  - HydraProofs generates all opening proofs in O(N) time
  - Directly compatible with zkSNARKs using multilinear encodings
  - Uses partitioning and folding to reduce HyperEval to linear time
  - Supports efficient multi-user verification when combined with GKR
  - In verifiable secret sharing, proving is faster than the dealer's computation
  - Enables robust aggregation verification in federated learning with low overhead
