- Kobi Gurkan discusses specific issues in the software supply chain for ZK provers, emphasizing the increasing importance of supply chain security with the trend towards data localization and proof sharing.
- Notes:
  - ZK proof privacy relies on reproducible builds, but supply chains are complex and vulnerable
  - Open-source audits are insufficient; need simplified trust models focusing on critical steps (e.g. builds)
  - Desktop apps are more reproducible; iOS is hardest due to closed ecosystem
  - Solutions: Open build systems, standardized environments, verifiable distribution
  - TEE reduces trust requirements but depends on reproducible builds
  - Industry trend: Enterprises push end-to-end verification, requiring stronger supply chain security
