📝 Comparing Ligerito and WHIR
- https://nmohnblatt.github.io/ligerito-and-whir/
- nmohnblatt compares Ligerito and WHIR in the blog, discussing their similarities and differences in recursive structures, Sumcheck constraints, and code usage.
- Notes:
  - WHIR supports only RS codes, with concise verification; Ligerito supports arbitrary linear codes, with broader applicability.
  - WHIR utilizes foldable properties, while Ligerito employs code switching technology.
  - WHIR has higher verification efficiency, while Ligerito generates proofs faster.
  - WHIR may produce smaller proofs, while Ligerito has better compatibility.
  - choose WHIR for verification efficiency, Ligerito for flexibility.
  - Blaze is a hybrid solution of both.
