📝 The path to secure and efficient zkVMs
- https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/secure-efficient-zkvms-progress/
- @a16zcrypto's @SuccinctJT discussed the security and performance challenges of zkVMs in blog, proposing a phased approach to achieving secure and efficient zkVMs.
- Notes:
  - The author foresaw the development of zkVMs in terms of security and performance stages.
  - Security stage: 1. Protocol correctness, 2. Verifier implementation correctness, 3. Prover implementation correctness.
  - Performance stage: 1. Reasonable verification cost, 2. At most 256k proof and 16ms verification time.
  - Currently at performance stage 1, security stage 1 has not been reached.
  - Although it is hope to reach performance stage 2 within two years, it may be at the cost of sacrificing security. A security stage upgrade may come with a performance stage downgrade.
