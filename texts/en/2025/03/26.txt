ðŸ’» ZKarnage: Stress Testing ZK Systems Through Maximum Pain
- https://github.com/yourbuddyconner/zkarnage
- @yourbuddyconner opened source ZKarnage, aiming to test the performance limits of Ethproof provers through worst-case attacks.
- Notes:
  - Construct worst case, forcing EVM to load large contracts to increase proving burden.
  - Use `EXTCODESIZE` bytecode to force EVM to load contract bytecode, increasing ZK circuit complexity. `EXTCODECOPY` is similar.
  - This operation consumes the least gas (~408 gas/KB), but is very complex in ZK circuits.
  - This repo provides tools to construct such worst cases.
