📄 On Extractability of the KZG Family of Polynomial Commitment Schemes
- https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/514
- Belohorec et al. proposed a unified framework in  for proving the soundness of KZG class polynomial commitment schemes, covering both single and multi-variable variants. By conceptualizing the proof technique of Lipmaa et al., they demonstrated the completeness and soundness of the integrity assumptions, allowing black-box extraction of multi-variable KZG schemes.
